# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.

The motivation is to have one central place for notes relevant to the pre-work.

The project was built to learn and practice fundamental web development concepts.

It solves the problem of not having a central place for prework notes.

I learned much about Git and the workflow along with a revision for web development fundamentals.
